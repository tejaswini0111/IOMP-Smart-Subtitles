00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000


2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.800
Let's contemplate the word enough, because I think it will play an important role going

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.300
forward

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.140
When I watch the news or scroll my feeds, I keep coming back to the same questions

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.360
Why, despite all our knowledge and innovation, do problems like poverty and pollution keep

6
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.460
plaguing humanity?

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.920
Why, despite astonishing advances in renewable energy and resource efficiency, is fossil

8
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.560
fuel use at an all-time high, as is our global ecological footprint?

9
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.660
And why, despite being responsible for the main part of that footprint, have rich countries

10
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.260
been experiencing stagnating, if not decreasing, well-being?

11
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.220
I'm a sustainability researcher with a background in econometrics, and I believe the answer

12
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.900
lies in the fact that solving poverty, caring for nature, or fostering well-being is not

13
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.880
the ultimate goal of our current economic system

14
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.080
Its goal is growth

15
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.180
Many take this for granted, but growth wasn't considered a moral goal for most of history

16
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.180
It was only officially measured around the middle of last century, through GDP

17
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.220
It then shifted into the core of our economic thinking, and from there into policymaking

18
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.500
and our collective psyche

19
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.640
Growth became synonymous with progress

20
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.180
Things went fast after that

21
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.200
Extinction rates went up, resource use and waste exploded

22
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.400
Some warned early on about the dangers of exponential growth on a finite planet

23
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:59.040
In 1972, a team of MIT scientists created a first-of-its-kind world model consisting

24
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.960
of over 200 interconnected variables

25
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.240
With it, they analyzed a question I mentioned earlier, why problems like poverty and pollution

26
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.740
persist

27
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.420
They published a book on their findings called The Limits to Growth, in which they warned

28
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.020
that continuing the business-as-usual growth pursuit would lead to societal breakdown

29
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.460
setting in around now

30
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.540
Breakdown doesn't mean the end of humanity, but a steep decline in well-being nonetheless

31
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.300
The book was a bestseller, but you may have never heard of it

32
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.700
The authors were derided as doomsayers, and their message over time buried

33
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.350
A few years back, I compared their now decades-old projections with what's happened since

34
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.690
I found empirical data closely aligning with the model's business-as-usual scenario, which

35
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.570
shows growth grinding to a halt around 2040 or so, followed by steep declines in things

36
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.510
like food production and well-being

37
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.630
My analysis also revealed that this breakdown could be avoided by letting go of the growth

38
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.030
pursuit and redirecting resources to meet human needs and protect nature directly

39
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.390
This indicates that what we do in the next few years will determine our well-being for

40
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.670
the rest of this century

41
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.540
And this now-or-never moment in history is up to us

42
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.940
Technology by itself will not save us

43
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.380
Despite aspirational talks of decoupling, the idea that the economy can grow without

44
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.180
resource use and pollution growing along with it, there's no decoupling

45
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.840
Certainly not for a full impact on the earth

46
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.580
Raw materials consumption has been around 1.2 kilograms per dollar GDP for two decades

47
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.960
while biodiversity loss, water scarcity, plastic pollution are all worsening

48
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.060
But even just considering carbon emissions, which per dollar GDP have decreased, sufficient

49
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.920
absolute decoupling, which is what we need, is nowhere in the data

50
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.820
Our choice isn't whether to keep growing or not

51
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.880
It's whether the end of growth will come by design or disaster

52
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.540
Either we choose our own limits or we'll have them forced upon us

53
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:42.000
Now that humankind has reached global, unparalleled power, limits to growth confront us with a

54
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.560
question we've never faced before

55
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.540
Who do we want to be?

56
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.020
And what world do we want to live in?

57
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.580
Here's where enough comes in

58
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.540
If I were to describe the Montauri need in the 21st century with one word, it would be

59
00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.340
enough

60
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.320
Enough as in no more

61
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.840
This is the limit, say, a planetary boundary

62
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.920
And enough as in sufficient, juxtaposing it to this exhausting grind for ever more and

63
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.300
instead invoking a notion of sharing, as in enough for each

64
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:27.580
I believe the only realistic plan to avoid breakdown and maintain global well-being lies

65
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.900
in this mindset shift, from never enough to enough for each

66
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.360
Change the goal of our economic system from growth to human and ecological well-being

67
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.520
A well-being economy

68
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.960
What would that look like?

69
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.400
We have an idea because we already pretend that's what we have

70
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.400
No vision statement reads, a world where growth perpetuates at all costs indefinitely

71
00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.160
It talks about how this organization contributes to society, because that's what we feel it

72
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.620
should do

73
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.540
In a well-being economy, business activities, government policies, and citizen behavior

74
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.620
are aimed at meeting our physical, social, and spiritual needs within planetary boundaries

75
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.920
It doesn't mean we're anti-growth

76
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.200
It just means we're more selective about it

77
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.880
We differentiate between what should and should not grow, depending on whether it contributes

78
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.580
to well-being

79
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.920
This implies different pathways towards a well-being economy for low- and high-income

80
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.540
countries

81
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.760
At small material footprints, growth more often correlates with well-being, including

82
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.900
through poverty reduction

83
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.800
So, poorer countries, below their share of earth-carrying capacity, may still need green

84
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.260
growth, economic expansion driven by clean technologies

85
00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.020
In richer countries, what has decoupled from growth is happiness

86
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:06.240
So, they can and should focus on reducing ecological footprints to sustainable levels

87
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.240
while safeguarding everyone's livelihood by sharing more equally

88
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.440
Let me stress, because I hear this misconception a lot, decentering growth doesn't mean shrinking

89
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.680
the economy until it crashes

90
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:27.440
It means reducing our environmental impact to within a safe operating space for life

91
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.300
as we know it

92
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.480
That's not going back to a poorer past

93
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.260
That's changing the forward direction away from a cliff

94
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.300
We'll still have houses with fridges, good schools, health care, profitable businesses

95
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.640
We'll go to jobs and parties

96
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.200
But social norms and economic dynamics will change

97
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.720
We'll redefine what has value, or what work we call productive

98
00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:00.960
With our needs securely met, this tradeoff between social and environmental benefits

99
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.080
which we often take as given, dissolves

100
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.240
Sharing more equally means less income and wealth inequality, improving social cohesion

101
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.720
and reducing wasteful, conspicuous consumption

102
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.820
Efficiency gains are used to work less instead of produce more

103
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:26.380
By not pursuing growth at all costs, we can avoid a lot of costs, like all the expenditure

104
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.500
on health care and cleanups due to pollution

105
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.400
Moving to a post-growth society isn't choosing permanent recession

106
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:43.420
It's flexing our free will to change our notion of prosperity from evermore to better

107
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.300
How probable is this economic transformation?

108
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.180
It's feasible. That's half the answer

109
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.400
We know what promotes well-being

110
00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.400
In fact, policies like zero tolerance on child poverty or GDP alternatives

111
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.100
are exchanged already in WECO, a partnership of self-proclaimed well-being governments

112
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.840
Dozens of cities are piloting post-growth frameworks to operate within explicit social

113
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.580
and environmental boundaries with practices like universal basic incomes

114
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.420
I love how companies that put people and planet legally above profit generate billions each year

115
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:32.120
How communities are taking back stewardship of their commons with co-ops in renewable energy

116
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.260
water or food

117
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:38.340
Or how recent experiments with shorter work weeks for the same pay were so successful

118
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.220
that most of those companies made it permanent

119
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:48.200
We also have the technological capabilities, which will be pivotal once directed towards the right goal

120
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.700
This redirection is indispensable

121
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.020
But of course, I'm regularly told the techno-optimist argument that it's not

122
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.700
And I always respond

123
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:08.100
Let's say we could replace the dying bee colonies with robot pollinators

124
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.480
Why do that?

125
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.160
If we can also advance regenerative agriculture, which doesn't cause insecticide

126
00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.180
Why dedicate our innovative powers to tree-planting drones?

127
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:26.760
When we can also use that thinking to redesign our economy so that existing forest isn't cut down

128
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:35.300
And that brings me to the other half of the answer to how probable a well-being economy is

129
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.320
It's promise

130
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.020
We'd have less stuff, but more of what we need

131
00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:43.840
Connection

132
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.800
Maintaining a sense of community and purpose is hard in this current economic system

133
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.700
which treats us as selfish, never satisfied consumers

134
00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:00.400
Research shows we're not just capable of caring for life, we derive joy and meaning from it

135
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.520
We can't be truly happy unless those around us thrive too

136
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.680
This economic transformation wouldn't be a capitulation to grim necessity

137
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.300
We'd want to do it even if we were not facing ecosystem collapse

138
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:22.340
Because a well-being economy fits much better who we want to be

139
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.020
And the world we long to live in

140
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:33.200
So, we started with these global problems and found that changing our economic system is imperative

141
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.840
But also feasible

142
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.360
And no sacrifice

143
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.520
But simply letting go of what's no longer serving us to find belonging

144
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.980
In a post-growth world of embraced interdependence

145
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.460
If that sounds spiritual, that's what a well-being economy delivers

146
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.240
Physical sufficiency, social abundance, and spiritual wealth

147
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:05.140
Including the peace of mind that this prosperity can last

148
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:06.540
Thank you

149
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.060
Thank you, Gaia

150
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.880
So, you spoke tonight about broader economic transformation

151
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.780
But what can we as individuals do?

152
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.120
Yes, you have to find your unique influence in the system

153
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.740
So, let's start by changing the system's narrative

154
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.420
We've been told the story of separation

155
00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.200
We are selfish, violent beings doomed to exploit our commons

156
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.980
So, the best thing we can hope for, then, is technology to save us

157
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.280
So, you would have to start by working from a different narrative

158
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.100
The story of interdependence in which we are nature

159
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:59.940
Once our needs are securely met, we rejoice in contributing to this web of life that we're all part of

160
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.780
So, you talk about bringing it back to the personal level

161
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.440
That's actually very emotional work

162
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.480
It's deeply personal

163
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.860
But, of course, it cannot stay there

164
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:14.140
So, then, the next step is to build out this new narrative in the system's structures

165
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.520
And that very much depends on where you are

166
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.360
If you're in a corporation, look into regenerative business models

167
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.860
If you're in government, look into well-being government policies

168
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.940
If you're an investor, see if you can transition from ESG assessments, which are relative

169
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:36.700
to the absolute assessments against social foundations and planetary boundaries

170
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.420
If you're an entrepreneur, look into employee ownership

171
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.600
Everyone, citizens, buy at not-for-profit companies

172
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.700
See if community solar makes sense for you

173
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.480
So, there's so many things that you can do

174
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.960
But it very much depends on where you are

175
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.000
But there is one general piece of advice that I can give

176
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.060
And that's work together and remember that systems change is not linear

177
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.260
So, people do this very disjointly at first

178
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:09.440
And then, over time, they build connections until a critical minority mass is reached

179
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.580
Typically around 25% or so

180
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.920
And only then does the majority come along

181
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.760
Because the system change becomes self-reinforcing

182
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:22.340
Now, there's no guarantee that that will happen for the economic transformation that I'm proposing

183
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.600
But, if it does, it will have been because people like you and that are gathered here today

184
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.660
contributed to that change in their own unique way

185
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.400
So, thank you for listening

186
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:34.720
Thank you, Gaia
